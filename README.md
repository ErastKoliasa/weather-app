# weather-app
In the program, you can find out the weather in the specified city.
The program was created using HTML, CSS, and JS.

In the input field, enter the name of the city, and then press the "Enter" button on the keyboard.
After that, the input field will be cleared, and a request for a sample with the city name entered in the input field will be sent to the auxiliary resource "https://api.openweathermap.org". 
The weather data received from the server will be displayed on the page.

If the city name is entered incorrectly, the corresponding alert will be displayed and the page will show the weather data for the default city ("London").
